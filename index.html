However, I will share my top three most exciting and beautiful places I have traveled to. I will include things I enjoyed most from each trip and some places I recommend to check out if you plan to visit. The areas that I will be talking about are LA, California, Mexico City, and Brazil. All these travels were crazy and unique experiences, so sit back and enjoy a quick summary of each location and amazing spots you should check out when in the area. I hope you enjoy it!</p>
