            	<p> Rating- 5/5 Mexico City was a wonderful experience. This trip was also memorable as I learned more about my culture and got to experience and see where my grandparents grew up. The food in Mexico is delicious; I recommend going to an excellent local taco spot. Many different food tucks/sets are also delicious and cheap. They are delicious, and the quality and taste are way better compared to the U.S. The drinks and snacks are also delicious and are a must-try! Starting I went to a Cruz Azul game, they played in the Stadium named "Azteca" this Stadium is one of the biggest and best in Mexico, the Stadium was massive and beautiful, and the crowd made the game better as they were passionate and into the game. The first spot I visited was the historic center of downtown Mexico City. Being downtown, there was a lot of movement and people, but there were terrific stores, many things to look at, and people having things to buy. The downtown area was very nice, with the famous National Palace building and the giant Mexican flag. Another fantastic place to visit is the pyramids of Teotihuacan. Teotihuacan is known for being the location of several highly architecturally significant Mesoamerican pyramids built during the pre-Columbian Americas era. Lastly, a fun place to visit on your visit to Mexico is the Chapultepec Castle, as you learn a lot about the Battle of Chapultepec, which is beautiful. Mexico City also has very lovely malls and areas to walk around and visit and many good museums! Although traffic is challenging in the city, it is beautiful and has many fun and memorable things to do! </p>
