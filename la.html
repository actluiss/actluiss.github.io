        	<h2>Los Angeles California</h2>
        	<main>
            	<p> Rating- 5/5 I went to LA for two weeks, and it still felt very short, as there were many things to do there! As soon as you arrive at the Los Angeles airport, you get a very chill summer vibe. For some reason, LA feels like you're in a movie, so every time I walked in the streets, I felt a good vibe, as there were also many people walking, many nice cars, and just movement everywhere! When I first arrived, I first saw the Hollywood Walk of Fame; there were streets with stars on the floor and celebrity names on them! This place is crowded as many people are walking, people selling items, and street performances! During my trip there, I went inside the wax museum, which was excellent, just seeing the many different structures. I recommend going to this museum as it was worth the money!
Another thing I liked about LA was Venice Beach and the Santa Monica Pier; sitting on the beach and just enjoying the day while watching many people pass or reading a book was very calming and relaxing. Next up, the rodeo drive was awe-inspiring. Just passing by all the luxury stores and seeing many nice cars pass by was terrific and a must when visiting LA! I also enjoyed visiting the many shops that they have there! Continuing one, it was my first time trying in and out, and it was very good. It is definitely a place you should visit, as in and out is very popular!
Another fun thing to do is go hiking; once you are on top, the view is breathtaking, and you can see the Hollywood sign; if you pick the right trail, you can also visit the Griffith Observatory, which is very cool! One last major thing that I did was go to Universal Studio; this speaks for itself, but going for at least 1-2 days at Universal is a good experience; there are so many things to do there, and the ride is fabulous! Overall, LA is an excellent place to visit, with good food, malls, and many other fun things to do! I highly recommend this place as your next place to travel to! Down below are some images from when I went ;)</p>
