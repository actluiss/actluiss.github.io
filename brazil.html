            	<p> Rating- 5/5 As I went to Brazil with my football team for a tournament, I got to experience many different towns and visit many stunning tourist locations. The food was very good, as I got to try many different types that are popular in Brazil, and it was super good! First the first location was Copacabana, a beach in Rio de Janeiro; the beach was lovely and had a good vibe as you were next to the city, and you could see all the buildings, which felt amazing! I also went on the Sugar Loaf cable car, which was a fantastic experience. I recommend visiting as you can see the whole city from up there; It was incredible. Next up was the famous Christ the Redeemer statue. It was huge in person and great seeing it in person; it's definitely something you need to see for yourself! I had the opportunity to visit the Estadio Urbano Caldeira, which is home to the team Santos. The stadium was very nice, and I got a tour of the locker rooms and press rooms and walk on the field! I went to the Museo Pele, a museum displaying the Pele's career. It had a lot of different things, and it was a fantastic museum. I highly recommend it to football fans! Overall, Brazil was fun and beautiful, and it is a place that I would visit again! Thanks!) </p>
